# Comprehensive Specification for a Python-Based Roguelike Game

This document outlines a detailed technical and design specification for a traditional roguelike game developed in Python, leveraging modern libraries and adhering to genre conventions. The game, tentatively titled *Dungeon Descent*, will emphasize procedural content generation, permadeath, turn-based combat, and emergent gameplay systems. The specification draws from established roguelike design principles[^3], implementation strategies from popular tutorials[^1][^2], and modular architecture patterns[^5][^6].

---

## Technical Specifications

### 1.1 Engine Foundations

- **Language**: Python 3.10+ with type hints for maintainability
- **Core Libraries**:
    - `tcod` (libtcod-py) for rendering, pathfinding, and field-of-view calculations[^1][^2]
    - `numpy` for efficient grid-based map data storage
    - `pygame` for input handling and audio (fallback if tcod limitations arise)[^4]
- **Architecture**: Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern with decoupled logic:

```python  
class Entity:  
    def __init__(self, x, y, char, color, name, blocks_movement=False):  
        self.x = x  
        self.y = y  
        self.char = char  
        self.color = color  
        self.name = name  
        self.blocks_movement = blocks_movement  
        self.components = {}  # Holds Fighter, Inventory, AI instances  

class Fighter:  
    def __init__(self, hp, defense, power):  
        self.hp = hp  
        self.defense = defense  
        self.power = power  
```

- **Rendering**: Hybrid ASCII/tileset support via tcod's console API, with:
    - 80x50 terminal resolution (1280x800 window)
    - Customizable font packs (12x12, 16x16, 32x32 tiles)
    - Layered rendering system for UI overlays (health bars, tooltips)


### 1.2 Procedural Generation Systems

- **Dungeon Layouts**:
    - Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) algorithm for room placement[^1]
    - Cellular automata for natural cave generation (10% wall chance, 4 iterations)
    - Prefab vaults (5% chance per level) with hand-designed challenge rooms
- **Content Population**:
    - Monster spawn tables weighted by depth:


| Depth | Enemy Types | Spawn Weight |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1-3 | Rat, Kobold, Giant Spider | 0.7, 0.2, 0.1 |
| 4-6 | Orc, Zombie, Cave Troll | 0.5, 0.3, 0.2 |

    - Loot distribution using rarity tiers (Common 60%, Uncommon 30%, Rare 10%)

---

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 2.1 Combat System

- **Turn Resolution**:

1. Player action (move/attack/use item)
2. NPC AI processing (A* pathfinding for hostile entities)[^2]
3. Environmental effects (fire spread, trap rearming)
- **Damage Formula**:

$$
\text{Damage} = \text{attacker.power} - \text{defender.defense} + \text{random}(-2, 2)
$$

Minimum 1 damage per successful hit[^1][^6]
- **Status Effects**:
    - Bleeding: 1d4 damage/turn for 3 turns
    - Poisoned: -2 to attack/damage rolls, stacks up to 3x
    - Burning: 2d6 fire damage, spreads to adjacent flammable tiles


### 2.2 AI Behaviors

- **Finite State Machine** with these states:

1. Idle (wander randomly in 5-tile radius)
2. Alert (pathfind directly to player)
3. Flee (when HP < 25%, use Dijkstra maps to escape)
- **Faction System**:
    - Hostile (red): Attack on sight
    - Neutral (yellow): Defend if attacked
    - Friendly (green): Provide quests/services


### 2.3 Inventory Management

- **Slot System**:
    - 26-slot backpack (A-Z keyboard mapping)
    - Equipment slots: Weapon, Armor, Ring x2, Amulet
- **Item Interactions**:
    - Scroll of Fireball: Targets 3x3 area, 4d6 damage (save vs DEX for half)
    - Potion of Healing: Restore 2d8+4 HP over 2 turns
    - Enchanted Sword +1: +1 to attack/damage rolls

---

## Content Design

### 3.1 Progression Systems

- **Character Development**:
    - XP required per level: $$
\text{1000} \times \text{level}^{1.5}
$$
- Per-level bonuses: +1d6 HP, +1 to one attribute (STR/DEX/INT)
- **Hunger Clock**:
- Food needed every 1500 turns (starvation: 1d4 damage/50 turns)
- Rations restore 500 turns, corpses provide 100-300 turns


### 3.2 Dungeon Ecology

- **Depth-Based Challenges**:


| Level | Theme | Hazards | Boss |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1-3 | Mines | Collapsing ceilings | Goblin King |
| 4-6 | Fungal Caverns | Spore clouds | Myconid Sovereign |
| 7-9 | Lava Pits | Fire geysers | Balrog |

- **Secret Discovery**:
    - 15% of walls are mineable (reveal hidden rooms)
    - Levers (5% chance) that disable traps or open vaults

---

## Development Roadmap

### 4.1 Phase Implementation

1. **Milestone 1 (6 weeks)**:
    - Core ECS architecture[^1][^5]
    - Dungeon generation (BSP + cellular automata)
    - Player movement/FOV (shadow casting algorithm)[^2]
2. **Milestone 2 (4 weeks)**:
    - Turn-based combat system[^6]
    - AI pathfinding (A* with tcod integration)
    - Inventory/equipment UI
3. **Milestone 3 (5 weeks)**:
    - Procedural loot tables
    - Status effect system
    - Save/load functionality (JSON serialization)[^1]

### 4.2 Testing Protocols

- **Unit Tests**: pytest coverage for core systems (≥80%)

```python  
def test_combat_damage():  
    attacker = Fighter(power=5, defense=0, hp=10)  
    defender = Fighter(power=0, defense=3, hp=10)  
    damage = calculate_damage(attacker, defender)  
    assert 1 <= damage <= (5 - 3 + 2)  # -2 to +2 variance  
```

- **Balance Testing**: Monte Carlo simulations for:
    - XP curve validation
    - Loot distribution fairness (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
    - 10,000 combat round analysis for win probabilities

## Conclusion

This specification provides a foundation for implementing a feature-complete roguelike adhering to genre traditions while incorporating modern quality-of-life improvements. By leveraging Python's tcod ecosystem[^1][^4] and ECS architecture patterns[^5], developers can create maintainable systems capable of supporting complex emergent gameplay. Future expansions could integrate modding support via Lua scripting[^3] or multiplayer through WebSocket protocols[^6], but the core design prioritizes a polished single-player experience true to roguelike roots.
